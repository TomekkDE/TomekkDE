        Oktoberfest in Germany is a big thing. It is everywhere in the country! From the<br></br>biggest city as Munich, Berlin, and Frankfurt to smaller cities like <br></br>Saarbr√ºcken, Trier, or Cologne. Yes, Oktoberfest takes even place in tiny towns <br></br>like Merzig, Dillingen, and Saarlouis. It starts in the middle of September<br></br> and attracts nearly everyone in Germany and goes on for two weeks. <br></br>A typical Oktoberfest contains a ferry wheel, various rides, and cotton candy <br></br>sellers, of course you also get German sausages on every corner of the <br></br>Oktoberfest, but the most important thing is a big tend that has been built <br></br>up. In this tend there are musicians and many many drunk people. People <br></br>dance on the benches with their friends and carry a third gallon of beer in <br></br>their hand and bet who chucks it the fastest.
