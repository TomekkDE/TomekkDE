    <p>Apple is one of the most known brands, is one of the most valuable brands on the <br></br>stock market, and is one of the most influential brands in our modern time. But <br></br>how did Apple achieve these tremendous successes?<br></br>
Apple is different from other brands. If you think about Dell, HP, or Lenovo, what picture <br></br>will be in your mind if you think about their computers? Plastic! Black plastic. <br></br>Appleâ€™s competition hardly uses materials like aluminum or stainless steel. <br></br>A MacBook feels very valuable because of its chassis, a Lenovo ThinkPad just feels <br></br>cheap. In fact, if you push with your finger on the material between the keyboards of <br></br>the laptop, a plastic laptop extremely bands and you just think how cheap it is. <br></br>A MacBook can withstand this pressure and only bands slightly. Apple uses valuable materials<br></br> and well-developed assembly processes so that people believe and feel how good <br></br>their MacBook or iPhone is. Steve Jobs once said that Apple does not want to sell <br></br>trash. Yes, I think Lenovo, HP, or Dell want to sell trash because they want to sell as many as<br></br> possible products to gain revenue. Apple wants to sell the best products, not <br></br>the most. Apple is a valued brand because of its focus on high quality.  <br></br>
